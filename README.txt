If you have any issue to work with the original Broker_and_Sensor then use the dependency improved version of the jar..

The Subscribe source can be found on Subscribe folder and there is a jar file too, which is located in two places one is the bin folder and second one is the root folder.

If you have any issue don not hesitate to ask me. I will be there for help you for free !

And again thank you so much for work with me. It's been a great experience.
